## google-pwapp
A fast, reliable, integrated and engaging pwapp developed using Google's code labs documentation.

##### Progressive Web App techniques:
- Use responsive design, so it works on both desktop and mobile.
- Be fast, using a service worker to precache the app resources (HTML, CSS, Javascript, images, etc) needed to run, and cache the weather data at runtime to improve performance.
- Be installable, using a web app manifest and the `beforeinstallprompt` event to notify the user it's installable.

##### Key learning points:
- How to create and add a web app manifest.
- How to provide a simple offline experience.
- How to provide a full offline experience.
- How to make you rapp installable.
